# 📊 Retail Staff and Sales Management System

This project is a **Retail Store Staff and Sales Management Web Application**, designed for modularity, scalability, and real-world usability. It was developed as part of a final-year Software Engineering project, with the aim of helping retail managers better organize rotas, staff, and sales — replacing traditional manual processes like Excel sheets.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The system consists of two main parts:

- **Backend API**: ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 6)
- **Frontend**: Angular 17 (separated from backend for better scalability)

The backend handles:
- Staff management
- Store management
- Sales tracking
- Rota scheduling
- Secure authentication with role-based access control

The frontend provides:
- A clean, modular, and easy-to-navigate user interface
- Pages for managing stores, staff, rotas, and sales
